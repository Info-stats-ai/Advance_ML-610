# What Is Artificial Intelligence
# ##############################################################################

## #############################################################################
## AI
## #############################################################################

* Human Intelligence
- We call ourselves "homo sapiens" because intelligence sets us apart from animals

- For thousands of years, we tried to understand how we think
  - Brain is a small mass of matter
  - How can brain perceive, understand, predict, and manipulate a world more
    complicated than itself?

* Artificial Intelligence
- The term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined in 1956

- **AI aims to:**
  - Understand human intelligence
  - Create intelligent entities

- **AI is a technology**
  - Universal and applicable to any human activity and task
  - Its impact greater than any previous historical event
  - Currently generates trillions of dollars annually in revenue
  - Presents many unresolved problems
    - E.g., major concepts in physics might be established

* AI Formal Definition
- AI is defined around **two axes**:
  - Thinking vs. Acting
  - Human vs. Rational (ideal performance)

- This leads to four possible definitions of AI as a machine that can:
  1. Think humanly
  2. Think rationally
  3. Act humanly
  4. Act rationally

* AI Formal Definition: Quiz
- Four possible definitions of AI as a machine that can:
  1. Think humanly
  2. Think rationally
  3. Act humanly
  4. Act rationally

- **Which one do you think is the best definition?**

* AI Formal Definition: Quiz
- Four possible definitions of AI as a machine that can:
  1. Think humanly
  2. Think rationally
  3. Act humanly
  4. Act rationally

- **Which one do you think is the best definition?**

- We will see that building machines that can **"act rationally"** should be
  ultimate goal of AI

* 1. AI as Thinking Humanly
- To build machines that think like humans we need to **determine how humans
  think**

- **Pros**
  - Express precise theory of the human mind as a computer program

- **Cons**
  - Unknown workings of the human mind
  - Anthropocentric definition

* 2. AI as Thinking Rationally
- What are the rules of "correct thinking"?
  - Given correct premises, yield correct conclusions

- **Logic** studies the "laws of thought"
  - Formalize statements about objects and their relations

- **Automatic theorem proving**
  - Programs solve problems in logical notation
  - Run indefinitely if no solution exists (related to the halting problem)

* Thinking Rationally: Cons

1. **Formalizing informal knowledge is difficult**
   - Example: _"A handshake occurs when two people extend, grip, shake hands,
     then release."_
   - Formal logic representation: 
     \begin{align*}
         &\exists x, y \, ( \text{Person}(x) \land \text{Person}(y) \land x \neq y \land \\
         &\quad \text{Hand}(x, h_x) \land \text{Hand}(y, h_y) \land \\
         &\quad \text{MoveToward}(h_x, h_y) \land \text{Contact}(h_x, h_y) \land \\
         &\quad \text{Shake}(h_x, h_y) \land \\
         &\quad \text{Release}(h_x, h_y) )
     \end{align*}
2. **Probabilistic nature of knowledge**
   - Example in medicine: _"Fever, cough, and fatigue could indicate flu,
     COVID-19, or another illness."_
3. **Scalability challenges**
   - Large problems may need heuristics for practical solutions
4. **Intelligence requires more than rational thinking**
   - Importance of agent interaction with the world
   - Problem of the "body"

* 3. AI as Acting Humanly
- **Agent** is something that perceives and acts to reach a goal
  - AI designs agent that can act like humans

- **(Embodied) Turing test**
  - _"A computer passes the Turing test if a human cannot tell whether the
    answers to questions came from a person or a computer"_
  - Passing the Turing test requires:
    1. Natural language processing to communicate in English
    2. Knowledge representation to store what it knows
    3. Automated reasoning to use stored knowledge to answer questions
    4. Machine learning to detect and extrapolate patterns
    5. Computer vision and speech recognition to perceive objects and understand
       human talking to them
    6. Robotics to manipulate objects and move around

* Turing Test: Pros and Cons

- **Pros**
  - Operational definition of intelligence
  - Sidestep philosophical vagueness of "What is consciousness? Can a machine
    think? ..."

- **Cons**
  - Anthropomorphic criteria define intelligence in human terms
    - Multiple forms of non-human intelligence exist
  - Intelligence in terms of Turing test
    - Design intelligence to imitate humans
    - Fool humans into thinking it's human
  - E.g., aeronautical engineering:
    - Focus on wind tunnels and aerodynamics
    - Not about designing machines that imitate birds
    - Not about fooling birds into thinking it's a bird

* 4. AI as Acting Rationally
- Rational agents $\iff$ do the "right thing" given what they know

- Computer agents that act rationally should:
  1. Operate autonomously
  2. Perceive environment
  3. Persist over a prolonged time period
  4. Adapt to change
  5. Create and pursue goals

* Acting Rationally as Ultimate Goal of AI
- Which definition of AI to use?
  - Acting vs. Thinking
  - Rational vs. Human

- **Acting > Thinking**
  - Acting rationally is broader than just thinking rationally

- **Rational > Human**
  - Rationality can be mathematically defined
  - Human behavior is shaped by evolutionary conditions

- AI focuses on **agents acting rationally**
  - I.e., "agents that do the right thing" based on available knowledge
  - E.g., you leave the house and a branch strikes you
    - Did you act rationally?
    - Probably
  - E.g., you cross the street and a car knocks you over
    - Did you act rationally?
    - Id depends!

* Goals of a Rational Agent
- A **rational agent** aims for:
  - The best outcome in a deterministic setup
  - The best expected outcome under uncertainty

- **Best** is determined by the objective function:
  - E.g., cost function, sum of rewards, loss function, utility

- **Problems** with acting rationally
  - Sometimes no provably correct action exists
    - Yet, an action must be taken
  - Perfect rationality is not always feasible due to:
    - Cost of acquiring all data
    - Computational demands
  - Acting "appropriately", "satisficing"

## #############################################################################
## Machine Learning
## #############################################################################

* Machine Learning: Definitions
- Artificial intelligence differs from human intelligence
  - Machines don't learn like humans (e.g., LLMs)

- _"Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to
  learn without being explicitly programmed"_, (Arthur Samuel, 1959)
- _"A computer program is said to learn from experience $E$ with respect to some
  task $T$ and some performance measure $P$, if $P(T)$ improves with experience
  $E$"_, (Tom Mitchell, 1998)

- Machine learning is the science of building machines capable of doing useful
  things without being explicitly programmed to do so
  - E.g. a computer learn to play checkers by playing against itself, memorizing
    which positions lead to winning a game

* Limits of ML Compared to Human Intelligence

- **Fragility to input variations**
  - ML models fail with slight input distortions
    - E.g., adversarial attacks cause misclassification by altering one pixel
    - E.g., a model trained for a video game may fail if the screen is slightly
      rotated; humans continue effortlessly

- **Lack of transfer learning**
  - ML systems cannot apply knowledge across domains without retraining

- **Massive data and compute requirements**
  - ML requires enormous datasets and computational resources
    - E.g., a teenager learns to drive in hours; self-driving systems need
      billions of compute hours and extensive data

- **Poor common sense and reasoning**
  - ML lacks built-in world knowledge and intuitive logic

* Limits of ML Compared to Human Intelligence

- **Opaque decision-making**
  - Many ML models offer little transparency into decision processes
    - Limits trust, interpretability, and accountability in critical
      applications

- **Dependence on narrow objectives**
  - ML systems excel at optimizing narrow tasks but fail with ambiguous goals
    - E.g., an algorithm maximizing user engagement may promote harmful
      content

- **Susceptibility to bias and data quality**
  - Models inherit and amplify biases in training data

- **Lack of embodiment and physical interaction**
  - Human cognition is grounded in physical and sensory experience

* The 3 Machine Learning Assumptions
- Machine learning involves solving a practical problem by:
  - Gathering a dataset
  - Building a statistical model from the dataset algorithmically

- The **three assumptions** of machine learning
  - A pattern exists
  - Pattern cannot be precisely defined mathematically
  - Data is available

- Which ML assumption is essential?
  - _A pattern exists_
    - If no pattern, try learning, measure effectiveness, conclude it doesn't
      work
  - _Cannot pin down pattern mathematically_
    - If solution is direct, ML not recommended, but may still apply
  - _We have data_
    - Without data, no progress can be made
    - Data is crucial

* Machine Learning Adages

- _"An explanation of the data should be as simple as possible, but not
  simpler"_ (Einstein)

- _"The simplest model that fits the data is also the most plausible"_ (Occam's
  razor)

- _"Garbage in, garbage out"_ (Fuechse, 1957)

- _"All models are wrong, but some are useful"_ (George E. P. Box, 1976)

- _"If you torture the data long enough it will confess whatever you want"_
  (Coase, 1982)

- _"Data is the new oil"_ (Humby, 2006)

- _"More data beats clever algorithms"_ (Norvig, ~2006)

- _"The unreasonable effectiveness of data"_ (Halevy, Norvig, Pereira, 2009)

    - Right or wrong determined by action's expected outcomes
    - E.g., "If you kill, you will go to jail"

  - Deontological ethics
    - Opposes consequentialism
    - "Right actions" based on universal laws, not outcomes
    - E.g., "don't kill", "don't lie"

* AI and Cognitive Psychology

* The Beginning (1943-1956)
- **Artificial neuron**
  - Model (McCullock-Pitts 1943) based on:
    - Brain physiology
    - Propositional logic
    - Computation theory
  - Compute any function with connected neurons
    - Neuron on/off based on stimulation from neighboring neurons
    - Implement logical AND, OR, NOT with simple neuron networks

- **Alan Turing, 1947**
  - Turing test, machine learning, reinforcement learning
  - Create human-level AI:
    - Develop learning algorithms
    - Teach machine like a child

- **Birth of AI**
  - McCarthy organized first AI workshop (1956)
  - The Logic Theorist
    - Programs to "think non-numerically" and prove theorems
    - Newell and Simon (1956)

* Enthusiasm and Great Expectations (1952-1969)

- **Early years of AI were full of successes**
  - Until than computers could only do arithmetics
  - _"A machine can never do games, puzzles, IQ tests, ..."_
  - AI researchers showed machines could do that after another

- **General Problem Server**
  - Imitate human problem-solving
  - Consider sub-goals and possible actions

- **Program learned to play checkers**
  - Use reinforcement learning from victories and mistakes

- **Lisp (1958)**
  - High-level language used for 30 years in AI

- **First neural network**
  - 3000 vacuum tubes for 40 neurons
  - Marvin Minsky (1959)

- **MIT and Stanford**
  - Minsky at MIT
    - Focus on neural network
  - McCarthy at Stanford
    - Focus on representation, logic

* A Dose of Reality (1966-1973)
- Researchers were confident about AI's upcoming successes

- AI didn't succeed on real problems due to:
  - Solutions based on human problem-solving methods
  - Difficulty handling "combinatorial explosion":
    - Theorem proving handles small problems with brute force, but doesn't scale
  - Neural networks needed algorithms (e.g., backpropagation), compute power,
    and data

* Expert Systems (1969-1979)

- **Weak AI (Narrow AI)**
  - Performs specific tasks, not general reasoning
  - Operates in a limited, well-defined domain
  - Uses "weak methods" (search, logic) that struggle to scale
  - Improves with domain-specific knowledge

- **Expert Systems**
  - Known as "knowledge-based systems"
  - Combine weak methods with extensive domain knowledge as rules
  - Use inference engines to apply rules to facts
  - E.g., rule-based systems, logic programming (e.g., Prolog)

- **Commercial Adoption and Industry Growth (1980–)**
  - AI shifted to practical applications
  - Major US corporations deployed expert systems
  - AI emerged as a commercial industry

* (First) AI Winter (1980)

- AI overconfidence/hype didn't deliver

- **Reasons:**
  - Building/maintaining expert systems is difficult
  - Reasoning methods ignore uncertainty
  - Systems can't learn from experience
  - E.g., expert systems in medical diagnosis struggle with complex, variable
    patient data
  - E.g., early AI chess systems couldn't adapt to new strategies without manual
    updates

* Return of Neural Networks (1986-)

- Mid-1980s: Discovered back-propagation algorithm
  - Developed in early 1960s

- **Connectionist approach vs. Symbolic approach**
  - Connectionist: Neural networks
    - E.g., recognizing handwritten digits
  - Symbolic: General Problem Solver
    - E.g., solving logical puzzles with rules

- **Why connectionist approach**
  - Concepts not well-defined using symbolic axioms
    - Forms fluid internal concepts
    - Represents real-world complexity better
  - Neural networks learn from examples
    - Adjust parameters for improved predictions
  - E.g.,
    - Image recognition: Identify objects by learning from labeled images

* Probabilistic Reasoning and ML (1987-)

- **AI and scientific method**
  - Rigorous methods to test performance
  - E.g., speech recognition, handwritten character recognition

- **Benchmarks for progress**
  - Examples:
    - MNIST: Handwritten digit recognition
    - ImageNet: Image object recognition
    - SAT Competitions: Boolean satisfiability solvers

- **AI shifts ...**
  - From Boolean logic to probability
  - From hand-coded rules to machine learning
  - From a-priori reasoning to experimental results

* Progress in Speech Recognition

- **1970s: Ad-hoc approaches**
  - Various architectures and approaches were attempted
  - Rule-based systems with limited robustness
  - Cons: Ad-hoc, fragile

- **1980s: HMMs**
  - Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) became dominant
  - Pros: Strong theoretical foundation
  - Methods: Effective learning techniques
  - Data: Trained on large speech corpora
  - No claim humans use HMMs for speech recognition

* Bayesian Networks

- **Bayesian networks**
  - Judea Pearl, 1988
  - AI is linked with:
    - Probability
    - Decision theory
    - Control theory
  - Efficiently represent uncertainty
  - Provide rigorous reasoning

- **Examples**
  - Diagnosing diseases based on symptoms
  - Predictive text input in smartphones
  - Fraud detection in banking

* Reinforcement Learning

- **Reinforcement learning**
  - Sutton, 1988
  - Reinforcement Learning (RL) involves agents learning by interacting with an
    environment
  - Markov Decision Problems (MDPs) provide a mathematical framework for modeling
    decision-making

- **Examples**
  - RL: A robot learning to navigate a maze by receiving rewards for successful
    paths
  - MDPs: A game strategy modeled where each move influences the outcome with
    certain probabilities

* Reunification

- **Reunification of AI with**:
  - Data
  - Statistical modeling
  - Optimization
  - Machine learning

- **Many subfields of AI were re-unified**:
  - Computer vision
  - Robotics
  - Speech recognition
  - Multi-agent systems
  - NLP

* Big Data (2001-Present)

- **Focus shifts from algorithms to data**
  - For 60 years, AI focused on algorithms and models

  - For some problems, data availability matters more than algorithms, e.g.,
    - Trillions of English words
    - Billions of web images
    - Billions of speech and video hours
    - Social network data
    - Click stream data

  - Algorithms leverage large datasets

- In 2011, IBM's Watson beat human Jeopardy! champions

* Deep Learning (2011-Present)

- **Deep learning**
  - Use ML models with multiple layers of computing elements
  - Ideas known since 1970s, but then forgot
  - Success in handwritten digit recognition in 1990s

- **In 2011, DL took off**
  - Surge of interest in AI among researchers, students, companies, investors,
    government, and public
  - In 2012, a DL system showed dramatic improvement in `ImageNet` competition
    - Previous systems used handcrafted features

- Today, DL exceeds human performance in several vision and speech recognition
  tasks
- DL needs specialized hardware (e.g., GPU, TPU, FGPA) for parallel tensor
  operations

- **General Artificial Intelligence**
  - Universal algorithm for learning and acting, not just specialized tasks
    (e.g., driving, playing chess, recognizing speech)

    function
  - Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning (CIRL)

* Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning (CIRL)

- AI infers human goals based on actions

- **Observation**: Alice looks tired, sits on the couch, observes the messy
  table, and starts watching TV

- **Inference**: AI infers:
  - Alice is tired and wants to relax
  - Messy coffee table bothers her

- **Action**: AI:
  - Fetches a glass of water
  - Tidies up the coffee table without disturbing Alice

- **Feedback loop**: AI monitors Alice's reactions
  - If Alice is relaxed and happy, AI understanding is reinforced
  - If Alice is not happy, AI adjusts actions and improves inference
